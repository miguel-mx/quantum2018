Dear Organizers of Quantum 2018:

Guillermo Alberto Estrada has asked me to send you this letter in support of his application for being an official participant in the 
Quantum 2018 conference. Guillermo is presently in his fifth semester of our MSc Physics program at the IFM/UMSNH.
Although he is not my thesis student, I know him well because he has taken my Statistical Physics course and, as an Oyente,
also part of my course on Quantum Field Theory. Guillermo is a very good student with a broad range of interests in Physics as well as in Philosophy, and in my opinion likely to take good profit of a conference like this that focuses on fundamental issues in 
quantum mechanics.

Yours truly,

Christian Schubert
