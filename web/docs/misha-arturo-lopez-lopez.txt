Dear Organizers of Quantum 2018:

My MSc thesis student Misha Arturo Lopez has asked me to send you this letter in support of his application for participation in
Quantum 2018. Misha is presently in his fourth semester of the MSc program of IFM/UMSNH and writing his thesis on off-shell photon amplitudes in the worldline formalism. He is a very good student, and an unusually goal-getting one; while our students normally start
their research work at the beginning of the third semester, Misha asked me for some opportunity to participate in my research projects
right after admission to the MSc. Correspondingly, at this stage he is quite advanced not only in his thesis work but also in his
education, which centers on field theory. However, his thesis work is of a rather technical nature, and participating in this congress
might provide for him some welcome break from the nitty-gritty, and exposure to more conceptual issues. 

Yours truly,

Christian Schubert
