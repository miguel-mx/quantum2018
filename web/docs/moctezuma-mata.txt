Dear Organizers of Quantum 2018:

My MSc student Cesar Moctezuma Mata has asked me to provide this letter in support of his participation in Quantum 2018.
Cesar is presently in his third semester of the MSc program of the IFM/UMSNH, and working with me on his thesis on the low-energy
limit of multi-photon amplitudes. I know him very well as a student and person, since he did already his undergraduate thesis with me, and he has been in my courses on quantum field theory and general relativity. While an undergraduate, he has moreover worked for me as an ayudante SNI 3, helping me with the exercise sessions of my general relativity courseas well as other things. 
Cesar is the kind of student whom one can ask to work on physics problems for which he has little or no background, and he will
do just whatever part of the problem is accessible to him, without ever getting discouraged or disgruntled. This ability to work with insufficient information is rare in my experience, and a hallmark of students who turn into good researchers. Since he has also a 
strong interest in philosophical matters (in fact he came to physics through philosophy) I think Cesar should not miss this congress,
even though admittedly he might find the mathematics difficult at this stage. 

Yours truly,

Christian Schubert
